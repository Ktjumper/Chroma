### How do I get set up? ###

pull the repo. In AndroidStudio, go to File -> New -> Import Project -> Find build.gradle from the pulled files.

Build/Run as you would normally.

The main place we'll be coding is core -> java -> com.mygdx.game -> MyGdxGame. For ex, the render() method is where I display our loading screen.
